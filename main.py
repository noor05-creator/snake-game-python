   Snake Game (main.py)

   This is the main file for the Snake Game built using Python's `turtle` graphics.
   It initializes the game window, creates the snake, food, and scoreboard objects,
   and manages the main game loop including movement, collision detection, and scoring.

   Modules used:
   - Screen (from turtle): For the game window
   - Snake (custom class): Controls snake movement and growth
   - Food (custom class): Manages random placement of food
   - Scoreboard (custom class): Displays and updates the score

   Controls:
       - Arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) â†’ Move the snake
